INOP’s API allows you to generate custom conversational interviews based on the skills you’d like to test. You call the API with the skills & more details about the role you’re hiring for, receive an interview link, and invite candidates.

The candidate then goes through a conversational interview and a coding exercise (if they’re an engineer). After they finish, you will receive reports on how they did. The report will include an AI rating per skill, a description of that rating, soft skills rating, proctoring score, and more.

Use our AI Interviewer to interview 100x more candidates at 1/10th the cost per interview.
