**INOP Talent Intelligence API**, a powerful AI-driven platform designed to **redefine talent screening, workforce planning, and professional development**. This API allows you to **generate a custom candidate screening profile** by analyzing a candidate’s profile against job descriptions, retrieve **existing applications and AI-driven screening recommendations**, and leverage **compensation analytics, skills intelligence, and career development insights**.

Traditional hiring and workforce planning often rely on **resumes, manual screening, and static job descriptions**, which fail to capture the true potential of candidates or anticipate future talent needs.
