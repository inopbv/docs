## Overview

**INOP Job Titles API** is a powerful and structured job classification system designed to bring consistency and intelligence to job title data. This API provides access to **INOP’s comprehensive library of job titles**, complete with **normalization capabilities**, **curated job title groupings**, and **skill mappings** for each title.

Organizations often deal with inconsistent, ambiguous, or unstructured job titles in hiring processes, job postings, and workforce analytics. **Job Titles API** addresses this challenge by offering a **standardized framework** to:
    * **Normalize raw job titles** – Convert unstructured job titles into standardized INOP-defined titles.
    * **Group related job titles** – Access curated job title clusters for better role categorization.
    * **Map job titles to required skills** – Gain insights into core and associated skills for each title.
