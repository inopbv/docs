## Overview

**INOP Skills API**, a comprehensive and structured skills taxonomy designed to support **skills-based hiring, workforce planning, and talent intelligence**. This API provides access to **INOP’s complete collection of skills**, each uniquely identified and categorized by skill type.

Organizations often struggle with **inconsistent skill definitions** and **unstructured skill data** when evaluating candidates, employees, or job descriptions. INOP Skills API standardizes skill classification, making it easier to integrate **AI-powered skill intelligence** into your hiring and workforce management processes.
